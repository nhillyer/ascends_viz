ASCENDS Data Visualization is a project to visualize CO2 readings from UAV
flights in support of the ASCENDS mission.  Data is processed from these
flights and then matched up with model outputs to create visualizations
in Google Earth.  The goal is to create a ground overlay of carbon column
readings and then a cross-sectional curtain file along the flight path.
